          <p> US restaurants generate an estimated 22 to 33 billion pounds of food waste each year. Drivers of food waste at restaurants include oversized portions, inflexibility of chain store management and extensive menu choices. 41 According to the Cornell University Food and Brand Lab, on average, diners leave 17 percent of their meals uneaten and 55 percent of edible leftovers are left at the restaurant. When the pandemic first happened there was a lot of extra waste,‚Äù Gunders tells Food Tank. She explains that the sudden closures of businesses created bottlenecks in supply chains. As a result, food could not reach people fast enough. Gunders explains that the pandemic has forced many restaurants to shift away from buffet models, a major contributor of food waste. She also says that restaurants, uncertain of their business, are offering smaller menus and, as a result, are keeping smaller inventories.
